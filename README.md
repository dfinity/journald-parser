## Introduction
Welcome to the Rust Parser for systemd-journal-gatewayd Logs project! This is an open-source Rust library designed to parse and extract relevant information from logs gathered via systemd-journal-gatewayd. The parser aims to provide developers and system administrators an efficient way to handle and analyze logs from the gatewayd service. The systemd logs protocol can be found [here](https://systemd.io/JOURNAL_EXPORT_FORMATS/)

Please note that this parser is specifically tailored to work with logs generated by systemd-journal-gatewayd and may not be compatible with logs from other sources or services. In addition it is specifically created to parse `Journal Export Format`.

## Features
* Efficient Parsing: The parser is designed to efficiently process large log files to extract valuable information while keeping resource usage in check.
* Structured Data: The parsed logs are transformed into structured data formats, allowing for easy manipulation and analysis.
* Error Handling: The parser implements robust error handling to gracefully handle malformed or unexpected log entries.

## Installation
To use the parser in your Rust code simply add it to your `Cargo.toml` file as follows:
```toml
[dependencies]
journald_parser = "0.1.0"
```

## Usage
The parser can be used as follows:
```rust
use journald_parser::parse;

fn main() {
    let data_as_bytes: Vec<u8> = fetch_logs();

    let batch = parse(data_as_bytes);

    // Do something with the parsed logs
    for entry in batch.get_entries() {
        println!("Entry: {:#?}", entry);
    }
}

fn fetch_logs() -> Vec<u8> {
    // Fetch logs from systemd-journal-gatewayd
    unimplemented!()
}
```
